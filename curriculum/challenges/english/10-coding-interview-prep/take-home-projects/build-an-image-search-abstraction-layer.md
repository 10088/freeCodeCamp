# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10> and browse recent search queries like this: <https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** You can get the image URLs, alt text and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.

**User Story:** You can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

**User Story:** You can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
