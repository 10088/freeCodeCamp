# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can share my polls with my friends.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can see the aggregate results of my polls.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can create a poll with any number of possible items.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see and vote on everyone's polls.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, if you don't like the options on a poll, you can create a new option.
